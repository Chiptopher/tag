# tag

### Overview
**tag** is a command line tool written in intended for file tagging. With **tag** you can keep track of all the tags your files have, the tags associated with a file, and much more. Since it's built of [Go](https://golang.org), you can install a binary for your machine free of dependencies.

### Installation

Prebuilt binaries are available in `windows`, `linux`, and `macOs` in both 32- and 64-bit versions. However, tag can be installed on any operating system that the `go` compiler runs on.

##### Installing From a Binary
To install the most recent stable version, navigate to the [stable directory](/bin/stable), and choose the binary that matches your operating system and architecture. Alternatively, you can use the table below.

|Operating System|Architecture|Link|
|---|---|---|
|Windows|64-bit|[Download](/bin/stable/windows/amd64/tag.exe)|
|Windows|32-bit|[Download](/bin/stable/windows/386/tag.exe)|
|Linux|64-bit|[Download](/bin/stable/linux/amd64/tag)|
|Linux|32-bit|[Download](/bin/stable/linux/386/tag)|
|macOS|64-bit|[Download](/bin/stable/darwin/amd64/tag)|
|macOS|32-bit|[Download](/bin/stable/darwin/386/tag)|

If you're looking for a specific version, all historical versions are located [here](/bin).

##### Installing From Source {InstallingFromSource}
If you have `go` all you need to do is get the source as you would any other go module.
```
go get github.com/Chiptopher/tag.git
```
